These are reference metrics from the SWPCTEST validation suite corresponding
to the Ottowa station magnetometer results as included in this folder.
Metrics were computed using Gabor Toth's "predict.pro" IDL procedure.

First group is |dB_H/dt| (where "db" values are dB/dt obtained through
empirical relation); second group is |B_H| metrics.
